# MobiDev Ruby Homework #1

This is simple repository to show that I can use git and write READMEs.

# Usage

To use shell script call it from the shell:  
```sh
sh script.sh
```

Then write something to the console and press ```Enter```. Script will output the same text.

To use ruby script:
```sh
ruby script.rb
```

This will output ```42``` to the console.  
**NOTE:** Ruby must be installed.
